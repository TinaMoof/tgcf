<br>
<p style="color:#ffffcc;font-size:20px;margin:0px">Xie Lian (谢怜, Xiè Lián), His Royal Highness the Crown Prince of Xianle, is the protagonist of Heaven Official's Blessing.

He was widely known throughout the Xianle nation as the beloved yet strange prince. Never showing interest in what was considered normal for a prince, he simply declared, "I want to save the common people!". Through practice, hard work, and insight beyond his years, he perfected his cultivation and ascended to the Heavens at the age of 17.

After multiple unfortunate events, he was twice banished from the Heavens. 800 years later, he ascended for the third time.</p> <br>
<p style="color:#ffffcc;font-size:20px;margin:0px"> Eight hundred years ago, Xie Lian was the Crown Prince of the Xian Le kingdom; one who was beloved by his citizens and the darling of the world. Unsurprisingly, he ascended to the Heavens at a very young age. Now, eight hundred years later, Xie Lian ascends to the Heavens for the third time as the laughingstock of all three realms. On his first task as a god, he meets a mysterious demon who rules the ghosts and terrifies the Heavens... yet unbeknownst to Xie Lian,
 this demon king has been paying attention to him for a very, very long time.</p>
