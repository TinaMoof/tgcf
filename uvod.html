<p style="color:#000000;font-size:20px;margin:0px">Heaven Official's Blessing (天官赐福, Tiān Guān Cì Fú) is a donghua based on the Chinese web novel of the same name. It's being produced by Bilibili and Haoliners Animation League. The first season debuted on the 31st of October 2020 at 11AM CST (China Standard Time) and has concluded on the 2nd of January 2021. As announced by Bilibili, the second season is currently in the works.</p>

<h2 style="color:#000000;font-size:34px;margin:0px">Gods</h2> 

<p style="color:#000000;font-size:20px;margin:0px">Gods, also known as Heavenly Officials (神官, Shénguān) are exceptional humans who ascended to the Heavenly Court</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 style="color:#000000;font-size:34px;margin:0px">Heavenly court</h3>

<p style="color:#000000;font-size:20px;margin:0px">The Heavenly Court (天庭, Tiāntíng), also simply called Heaven or Heavenly Realm, is a term used to refer to the collective of all Gods and the realm of deities. It is divided into the Upper Heaven and the Middle Heaven. The Middle Heaven used to be called Lower Heaven, but they changed it due to Lower Heaven sounding too cheap when Gods of that rank would announce it to mortals.</p>

<h4 style="color:#000000;font-size:34px;margin:0px">Canonical setting</h4> 
<p style="color:#000000;font-size:20px;margin:0px">In Xianxia novels, notable humans commonly can reach the status of godhood through cultivation. However, in the setting of Heaven Official's Blessing, cultivation does not seem to be a condition as one could ascend through outstanding merits reached while being a mortal. There are those who ascended purely through their cultivation like Mu Qing, those who ascended through their incredible deeds like The Rain Master and those who ascended through both like Xie Lian. 

The Heaven itself is full of these outstanding people. Everyone is the beloved child of heaven, many of them are princes, princesses or great generals. As such everyone called each other with their respective titles to be polite.

Gods are powered by the faith and worship of their believer, so much so that the currency used in heaven are the number of incense sticks burnt in the temple of each official. These incense sticks are called "merits". Without the faith and worship of their followers, gods would simply fade away into nonexistence while gods with a high number of followers will become stronger.

As they live and die by the belief of humans, Heavenly Official needs a good reputation to survive. This means sometimes using deception to maintain their followers; for example, a female Civil God like Ling Wen has to disguise herself as a man whenever she visits her believer's dream as the people believed no woman could become a competent Civil God and thus worshiped her as a man.

This means that the mythology created by and the perception of one's god follower might not be accurate. The chief example is the relationship between Water Master Wudu and Wind Master Qingxuan. Though they are blood brothers and usually worshiped in the same temple because of their close relationship, their followers found it distasteful to worship two male gods in one temple and Shi Qingxuan is changed into a female god by popular culture. This twisted their original mythology from a pair of brothers into brother and sister or even wife and husband. Consequently, as more people believed in a female Wind Master, Shi Qingxuan is more powerful in female form just like Ling Wen is more powerful in male form.

The gods/Heavenly Officials of Chinese beliefs are not all-powerful like the western conception of God. Rather, they too are bound by the dao (道) which has many meanings in Chinese culture but can be understood in layman’s tern as "fate". Though powerful and immortal, whether these gods have the potential to ascend or not are decided by the dao and it cannot be controlled (though, in certain situations, can be tricked). This bondage can be clearly seen in Xie Lian’s incapability of killing Lang Ying in book 2 at the height of XianLe civil war. Lang Ying has been chosen by fate to become king and thus are untouchable by the divine hands of gods.</p>
